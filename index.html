        <p>Hey There! I'm Aymaan, a computer science student at George Mason Univeristy.
          I love bridging people together, sharing opportunities, and creating memorable experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from computer science, I am passionately working on building my own 501(3)(c) non-profit organization.
          I have completed an internship with VAE, Inc. where I worked with senior engineers and military officials
          to assess and implement network upgrades. Along with this, I spent my winter break traveling abroad to Bangladesh
          to revisit my roots and document the immense development of the country through interviews with locals.
          </p>
          <p>
          When I am NOT bouncing around from passion to passion, I am working with my local mosque to organize various youth events,
          going to car meets,  learning about/trading the financial markets, going to art museums, and reading (especially memoirs!)!
        </p>
